;; Studio demo
;; ================
;;
;; Welcome to Studio, a Scheme-based GUI
;; for the libfive CAD kernel.


;; Shapes are defined in this pane, and rendered
;; on the right.  You can start with shapes from
;; the standard library, e.g.
(box #[-1 -1 -1] #[1 1 0])

;; Any top-level expression that evaluates to a
;; shape will be rendered as a mesh.  You can
;; control bounds and resolution in the View menu.


;; Shapes can also be defined as arbitrary distance
;; fields, expressed as functions of x, y, z.
;; Here's the distance-field expression for a sphere:
(lambda-shape (x y z)
 (- (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y) (* z z))) 1))


;; Of course, this is a full Scheme interpreter,
;; so you can also do arbitrary computations.
;;
;; The result of the last computation is shown in
;; the pane below.  Here, we'll find the first 10
;; numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:
(reverse
  (let fib ((fs '(1 1)))
   (if (= 10 (length fs)) fs
     (fib (cons (+ (car fs) (cadr fs)) fs))
)))


;; Errors are marked with a red underline and
;; an error message in the box.  Uncomment out
;; this line to see what that looks like:
;(+ 1 "not a number")


;; To learn more, dig into the source code;
;; documentation is sparse at the moment, but
;; libfive-guile.cpp should be informative.
